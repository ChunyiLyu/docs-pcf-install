Q: I AM A CUSTOMER HEADQUARTERED IN THE US WITH ANOTHER LOCATION IN CHINA, BUT AM EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS DOWNLOADING PIVOTAL SOFTWARE DIRECTLY TO MY CHINA LOCATION. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

Disclaimer: This question has legal implications, and Pivotal cannot provide legal advice to anyone about their specific obligations under any applicable laws and regulations in China or elsewhere (including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations on import/export and cyber security). So you should seek legal guidance regarding your own import/export compliance under all the applicable laws or other obligations regarding this issue. The following information is provided to you for your reference only. Pivotal expressly disclaims all liabilities in respect to actions taken or not taken based on the following information.

Certain customers have used the following solution under the following use case, which may or may not address your issue. A customer headquartered in the United States (U.S.) has another location in China, each with their own environments/systems. Customer downloads our software from Pivotal Network (PivNet) from our PivNet servers in the U.S. Customer employee then copies our software from the customer's environment in the U.S. to customer's environment in China. Customer’s China location then uses that locally available version of our software, instead of downloading it directly from PivNet to customer's China location.

##<a id="offline-pipes"></a> Offline Pipelines for Airgapped Environments

<img src="images/offline-env-diagram.png" alt="offline-env-diagram" width="320" align="right"/>

Offline Pipelines are a solution for computer networks physically isolated from the Internet.

The pipelines require all artifacts, such as release files, Docker images and scripts, to be provided from within the airgapped environment. For this to happen they first have to be downloaded and packaged in an Internet connected network.

###<a id="implementation"></a> Implementation

The offline pipelines implementation rely on Concourse's [s3-resource](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource) to retrieve the required artifacts from an S3-compatible blobstore. There are many S3-compatible blobstores that can be used from within airgapped environments such as [Minio](https://minio.io/) and [Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage](https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/storage/ecs/index.htm).

The current implementation of these pipelines applies to airgapped environments where the internal S3 repository is bootstrapped by moving tar files previously packaged from another Internet connected environment. Also, it assumes the existence of one Concourse server in each environment to run the corresponding pipeline.

####<a id="bootstrap"></a> Bootstrap

As illustrated in the diagram below, two pipelines are provided to help bootstrap the offline environment, `create-offline-pinned-pipelines` and `unpack-pcf-pipelines-combined`, that are meant to be used to facilitate physical transfer of artifacts to the airgapped environment.

**Pipelines execution flow**

1. Download artifacts from external sources, sign, package and upload them to S3 repository
2. Move packaged artifacts to disconnect environment's S3 repository (manual or automated)
3. Unpack artifacts, check their signature and setup offline `pcf-pipelines` with new artifacts
4. `pcf-pipelines` are triggered upon existence of new artifacts in S3 repository
5. PCF is deployed by `pcf-pipelines` in disconnected environment

**Pipelines**

[`create-offline-pinned-pipelines`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/tree/master/create-offline-pinned-pipelines) is used to:

* Pull all required resources (images, products and pipelines) from their locations on the Internet and package them
* Transform `pcf-pipelines` to consume the resources from S3-compatible blobstore,
* Create an encrypted tarball with all resources, and a shasum manifest for each resource,
* Put the tarball to a location within S3 storage for it to be transferred to the airgapped environment.

[`unpack-pcf-pipelines-combined`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/tree/master/unpack-pcf-pipelines-combined) is used to:

* Download, decrypt, and extract the GPG-encrypted tarball into its components after it has transferred to the `pcf-pipelines-combined/` path in S3-compatible store,
* Verify the `shasum` manifest of the tarball contents,
* Put the tarball parts into their appropriate locations within the airgapped S3 storage for use by the pipelines.

![unpack-pcf-pipelines-combined](images/unpack-pcf-pipelines-combined.png)

From this point the `pcf-pipelines` folder in the configured S3 bucket in the airgapped environment contains the pcf-pipelines tarball that can then be used to set a pipeline on an airgapped Concourse, in the same fashion as a standard `pcf-pipelines` setup.

### Requirements

* The online environment must have access to Dockerhub and Pivnet
* Concourse 3.3.3+ in both online and airgapped environments

#### Bootstrapping

For the `unpack-pcf-pipelines-combined` to work there must be a single manual transfer of the czero-cflinuxfs2 tarball to the czero-cflinuxfs2 folder within the airgapped environment's S3 storage. Only after that is done can the `unpack-pcf-pipelines-combined` pipeline be set and unpaused.
